C - printf Description

Well, this function(_printf) is an exact replica of printf function ,and we are creating it using Variadic funcions ( functions with a variable number of agrument),structs and multiple helper functions.This program will be able to display inputed characters,strings,integers,and decimals(base 10). Whatever format specificer you use with our _prinf function, should display the same results when used by the actual printf function.

If successfully compiled and executed, the function should return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings). And if it fails, then the function should return a (-1) upon error and "(null)" if the string argument takes in NULL. If the format specifier is unkown, then the output would print out the format specifier as a string.

This project is to show an alternative method of creating your very own simple printf function in the C programming language.
